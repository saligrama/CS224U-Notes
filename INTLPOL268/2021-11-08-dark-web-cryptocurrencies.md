# The Dark Web

## Internet routing
* The ideal: anarchism; "The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it"
* In reality: a few centralized providers maintain infrastructure for all internet communications
    - A LOT of traffic flows through the US
    - NSA saw this as an opportunity for surveillance
* Also: China's censorship is extremely effective! 
    - Can do blocking on traffic that leaves Chinese servers
    - A solution has been to use VPNs, though blocking tech has gotten better

## The Onion Router (TOR)
* Web browser that communicates (encrypted) with a series of nodes that forward traffic, eventually to exit node and to unencrypted open internet
* TOR is in an arms race with the PRC; PRC tries to shut down TOR access

### .onion services
* Traffic encrypted in layers, each node in the network removes a layer of encryption
* Example: The Silk Road, online drug marketplace
    - This got shut down by the FBI in 2013
