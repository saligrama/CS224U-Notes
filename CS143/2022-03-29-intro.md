# Compilers

## Course structure

* Course has theoretical and practical aspects
    - Need both in programming languages!
* Written assignments and exams cover theory
* Programming assignments cover the practical/systems part

## Course goal

* Open lid of compilers and see inside
    - Understand what they do, how they work, how to build them
* Correctness over performance
    - Will not cover lots of optimizations - will need CS243 for it

## Course project

* Write own compiler in four parts:
    - PA1: lexer
    - PA2: parser
    - PA3: type checker
    - PA4: code generation

## How are languages implemented?

* Two major strategies
    - Interpreters run the program
        - Program -> Interpreter -> Machine
        - Dominate high-level languages: Python, Ruby, Lisp
    - Compilers translate the program
        - Program -> Compiler -> Binary Code -> Machine
        - Dominate low-level languages: C, C++, Go, Rust
* Some language implementations provide both
    - Java, Javascript, WebAssembly
    - Interpreter + Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler

## Compiler structure

### Lexical Analysis (lexer)

* Divides program text into "words" or "tokens"

e.g. `if x == y then z = 1; else z = 2` translates into

```json
{
    "if": keyword,
    " ": whitespace,
    "x": variable,
    "==": operator,
    "y": variable,
    "then": keyword,
    "z": variable,
    "=": operator,
    "1": constant,
    ";": operator,
    "else": keyword,
    "2": constant
}
```

### Parsing
* Maps out relationship between tokens
* Stores this relationship as a tree data structure in memory

### Semantic Analysis

* Compilers perform limited semantic analysis to catch inconsistencies

### Optimization

* Automatically modify programs so that they
    - Run faster
    - Use less memory
* Note: course project has no optimization component
    - CS 243: Program Analysis and Optimization

### Code Generation

* Produces assembly code

### Intermediate representations

* Many compilers perform translations between sucessive intermediate languages
    - All but first and last are intermediate representations native to compiler
* Generally ordered in descending level of abstraction
    - Highest is source
    - Lowest is assembly
* Useful because lower levels expose features hidden by higher levels
    - Registers
    - Memory layout
    - Raw pointers
    - etc.
* But lower levels obscure higher-level meaning
    - Classes
    - Higher-order functions
    - Loops

### Issues

* How to handle erroneous programs?
* Language design has big impact on compiler
    - Determines what is easy and hard to compile
