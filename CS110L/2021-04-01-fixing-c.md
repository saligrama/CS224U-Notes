# C/C++ tools for code safety

## Dynamic analysis

## Valgrind
* On-the fly instrumentation of binaries
* Works with all binaries compiled by all compilers, even without source code/debug symbols
* Drawback: Not much information in binaries; no information about stack allocation (so no detection of stack buffer overflows)

### LLVM sanitizers
* Instrumentation of source code
* Provided by LLVM compiler suite (i.e., Clang)
* More information because source code is instrumented rather than binaries

Examples:
* `AddressSanitizer` - finds improper memory addresses
* `LeakSanitizer` - finds memory leaks
* `MemorySanitizer` - finds uses of uninitialized memory
* `UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer` - finds usage of null pointers, integer/float overflow, etc
* `ThreadSanitizer` - finds improper uses of threads

### Weaknesses of dynamic analysis
* Dynamic analysis can only report bad behavior that actually happened
* Requires inputs which would cause bad behavior to be input to catch such behavior

### Fuzzing
* Blind fuzzing: throw many random inputs at a program
* Coverage-guided fuzzing:
1. Take normal input, run it through the program, observe control flow
2. Semi-randomly mutate the normal input
3. Run program again and observe control flow
4. Keep mutated inputs that changed control flow
5. Return to step 2 with these kept inputs, infinitely

Common fuzzers: AFL and `libfuzzer`

Still cannot guarantee that a program is bug-free (if the fuzzer didn't find anything in some amount of time, maybe we didn't run it long enough)

## Static analysis

### Linting
* Basic static analysis: simple techniques to find obvious mistakes
* Person running linter can configure rules to enforce
* ex. `clang-tidy` - can auto-fix some issues!

### Dataflow analysis
* Walks through every branch of the abstract syntax tree looking for issues

Limitations:
* False positives: dataflow analysis follows every branch, even if it's impossible for some condition to be true in real life
    - If there are a lot of false positives (low signal-to-noise ratio), it's difficult to actually figure out which issues pointed out are real problems
* Many static analyzers only analyze a single file at a time, so some bugs won't be found if they are split across files

### Limitations of static analysis
* Hard to tell whether code is safe without broader context if we can only look at a few lines of code
* Impossible to generally get broader context due to halting problem

How to verify small snippets of code in isolation without broader context?
* This can be done adding a little bit of information to the code
* This is what Rust does!
