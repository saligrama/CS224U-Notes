# Threads
Definition: a thread is a sequential execution stream (i.e., executes instructions sequentially, one after another)

## Virtualization
Concept: one thing can behave like another - indistinguishably so

Why? Because modern computer hardware deals with threads in a complex, parallel (rather than serial) way, but we can treat threads as single units without having to worry about complex hardware interactions

## Execution state
Definition: Everything that can affect a thread, or be affected by it

Examples: 
* Variables
* Memory
* Interrupts
* Call stack (private)
* Registers (private)
* Cache
* Open files
* Network connection
* Clock

## Process
Definition: One or more threads and their execution state

### Process model
* Earliest OSes: single-tasking (1 process, 1 thread)
* By the late 1970s: multitasking (many processes, 1 thread per process)
    - First on server/mainframe OSes, quickly spread to PC OSes
* 1990s: multithreading (many threads per process)
    - Why? Uses multiprocessors well
    - Also, as structuring tool to separate out independent tasks of a program

# Processors
Today: Processors have multiple cores, each running a thread; some cores can run two threads (hyperthreading)

Tpyical server: 2 chips, 12 cores, 2-way hyperthreading: 48 simultaneous threads

# Dispatching
* Every thread can run a process (*fair scheduling*)
* Threads don't change each other's state (*protection*)

## Process control block (per process)
* Saved state for threads
* Scheduling information
* Memory for process
* Open files
* Accounting

## Thread states

Why no arrow from ready to blocked? Because the thread needs to run in order to wait on a resource, which is what blocked denotes.

## Dispatchers
1. Let thread run
2. Save state
3. Load state of new thread
4. See step 1

### Context switch
What: Change core's current thread

How:
1. Save registers on stack
2. Save stack pointer in process control block (PCB)
3. Load stack pointer for new thread
4. Pop register from stack
5. Return

What makes the dispatcher run?
* Interrupt (generated by hardware timer, disk I/O or keyboard input)
* Traps: Code written in the thread that forces it to run OS code
    - System calls
    - Errors
    - Page fault
