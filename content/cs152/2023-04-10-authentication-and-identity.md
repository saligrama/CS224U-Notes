# Authentication and Identity

Digital identity mappings:

* Organization <-> infrastructure
    - Phishing
    - MITM attacks
    - Typo squatting
    - Mismatched domains
    - Internationalized domain name (IDN) homograph attack
    - Email security
* User <-> account
    - Stealing passwords
    - Cracked breached password databases
    - Credential stuffing
    - Malware / Trojans
* Account <-> real human

Black markets allow for specialization of effort:

* Markets for stolen data
* Malware
* Phish kits
* Hacking for hire
* Botnets

## Authentication and Authorization

* Authentication (authn) - Whether users are who they claim to be
* Authorization (authz) - What users are and aren't allowed to access

Authentication: idenification + challenges (e.g., password, second-factor auth)
