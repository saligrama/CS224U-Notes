# Designing for Trust, Safety, and Privacy

Guest lecture: Karen Maxim, Policy & Law Enforcement Response Team Lead at Zoom Trust & Safety

* Initially: Zoom as a B2B company -- for companies to meet other companies + clients
    - "Closed meeting space" -- not designed for wider things like classrooms and city council meetings
    - Did not need much in the way of T&S function
* First set of reports: "Illicit Content and Substances" (ICS), sex/drugs parties, needed to shut down, but predictable work
* Zoom T&S: established in response to crisis of zoom-bombing @ beginning of pandemic

## Basic definitions

* Surface: a technical "entry point" to interact with a system
    - e.g. Facebook, public profiles, private groups, live video streaming, private messaging
    - For users and abusers: think about entry points for abuse
        - What design elements do people create content in vs consume content from?
        - What are potentials for abuse while creating content?
* Features -> Affordances -> Outcomes
    - Features: design elements that offer specific types of capabilities offered by the system
    - Affordances: possibilities for action available in a given environment
    - Outcomes: actions or other behaviors connected with the goals of the user

## ABC framework

* **Actors**: abusive actors
    - Who are users? What is intent? What networks are they situated in?
* **Behaviors**: deceptive behaviors
    - What do actors do? What are actions that repeat offenders take?
* **Content**: harmful content
    - What kinds of content is created or viewed that can be harmful?

## Measurement for internal management

* T&S perceived by execs as a "cost center" and drag on product
* Goal of measurement: support investment in T&S work
    - Goals: user trust, civil communication, healthy interactions, sense of safety
* How can we know T&S is doing a good job? That users trust platform and feel safe?
    - User surveys?
    - But data is subjective and noisy
* Abuse leads to poor experience, has impact on uesr trust, and can lead to user harm
* Measurement via internal and external methods
