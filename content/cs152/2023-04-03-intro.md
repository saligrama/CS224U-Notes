# Trust and Safety Engineering

## What is Trust and Safety?

* The study of how people abuse the results to cause harm
    - Often using products the way they are designed to work
* Crosses between specialties -- requires understanding of society and humanity
* Dynamic and unpredictable

## Course goals

* Have empathy for a broad cross section of the people who use your products and the risks they face
* Explain to software engineers and product managers the common ways that internet technologies are used to cause harm
* Recognize the pattern of how long-existing societal challenges (hate speech, disinformation, child abuse) can be amplified by internet technologies
* Understand how to anticipate safety risks for a proposed product
* Design and implement a functional abuse reporting flow powered by a machine learning classifier

## T&S Challenges

1. Scale
    - How to reason about human-created issues at billions-scale?
    - Especially with lopsided ratio of T&S (or really any) employees to users
2. Non-diverse studies and solutions
    - Solutions are broken -- because procedures only reflect assumptions about people similar to designers
3. Measurement and definition challenges
    - Can't fix anything without measurement
    - But measuring abuse is extremely difficult!
4. Privacy vs Safety
    - How to keep people safe while trying to respect privacy of their information?
    - End-to-end encryption adds challenges
5. Information sharing and division of responsibility
6. Government vs private action
    - In both security and T&S, private actors do 90% of the work and make most of the decision
    - Law enforcement has an important, but limited role
    - How to act in a quasi-governmental way while respecting privacy of users (many of whom do not live in democracies)?
7. Fairness in ML solutions?
    - ML is critical to any reasonable T&S program
    - But: predictability and fairness is unclear
8. Freedom of expression
    - T&S issues create broad agreement on certain positions (e.g., banning CSAM)
    - But: some issues are much more split and controversial (e.g. vaccine misinfo)
    - When acting in a quasi-governmental context, how to reason around people's freedom of expression?

## Areas of T&S work

### Policy and research

* Defining abuse types
* Building measurements and metrics
* Performing field studies
* Interviewing users and victims
* Working with governmental affairs teams
* Provides data and ideas to product

### Product and engineering

* Red teaming product designs
* Designing UX to encourage good behavior
* Building detection and moderation mechanisms
* Building and training ML

### Operations

* Defining appropriate behavior
* Building operational pipelines
* Sorting and handling billions of events
* Implementing constant improvement through self-testing and QA

### Investigations

* Investigates worst cases or most effective adversarial actors
* Handles incoming LE requests and external referrals
