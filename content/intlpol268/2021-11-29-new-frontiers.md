# New Frontiers

## China

* 5 of the largest Internet platforms are Chinese
    - TikTok: first to become dominant globally without Chinese government help
* PRC-based companies:
    - Have to deal with political content moderation requirements
    - Less experienced with safety issues as Western companies are
    - Are not experienced with Western privacy laws
    - Might store data in the PRC
    - Could decide to not follow ECPA
* Crackdown on PRC-based tech CEOs that publicly disagree with CCP policies or that present a threat to Xi Jinping's power

## Synthetic Media

* Example: DNC email hack in 2016
* Can create fake Facebook/Twitter profiles to mislead
* Types of abuse where falsity isn't relevant to impact:
    - Fake accounts
    - Sextortion
    - Harassment
    - Spam
    - Hate speech
    - NCII
* These are ripe grounds for deepfakes

## IOT

* Everything is a computer! (@internetofshit on Twitter)
* Computers are easy to hack, especially given trickle-down of attacks from state actors when they are released
* Combination of the two is very dangerous - lots of potential for spying or other harassment

## State and financial attacks on individuals

* Just two days ago (11/27/2021): NYT article on Iran-Israel hacking of gas IT and dating apps
* Cryptocurrency scams and hacking, etc

## Security is only the tip of the harm iceberg

Alternatively: Stamos's hierarchy of bad stuff that happens on the internet

* Biggest issue: abuse (technically legal use of a platform to cause harm)
* Infosec: only 20% of the iceberg
    - Account lifecycle/passwords (large majority)
    - Corporate patching (attacks from security updates not being applied)
    - Config errors
    - Old app vulns
    - Tip of this iceberg: new research
        - Tip of this iceberg: 0-day
        - Even smaller: side-channel attacks
