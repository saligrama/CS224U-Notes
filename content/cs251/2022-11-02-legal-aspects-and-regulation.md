# Cryptocurrency Law and Regulation

Guest lecture by Jake Chervinsky, The Blockchain Association

## Basics of regulations

* Regulations: rules that either prohibit conduct or condition it on compliance with specific obligations; call for punishment of violators
* Purpose: control market power, facilitate competition, attract investment, protect consumers, achieve other government interests

### Regulation in the US

* Creators and enforcers of regulation:
    - Regulation on both state, federal level
    - Legislature makes laws, executive enforces law, judiciary interprets laws
    - Elected vs. appointed officials, policymakers vs. enforcers
* Codification:
    - United States Code (USC) - actual laws/statutes passed by Congress
    - Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) - regulations by executive agencies
    - Plus guidance, settlements, no-action letters, etc.
    - Unique system in all 50 states

## Regulators and Frameworks for Crypto Regulation

### Securities laws

* The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
    - Mission: protect investors, facilitate capital formation, maintain fair, orderly, efficient markets
    - Federal securities laws originated in 1930s after Great Depression, seen as being caused by financial abuse and info. asymmetry
    - SEC regulates "securities" and a broad range of securities market actors
* Crypto x Securities
    - Securities: subject to regulatory requirements that may not work with crypto
        - Registration with SEC, traded on SEC-regulated venues, held by SEC-approved custodians, etc.
    - Crypto industry spends a lot of time and money avoiding SEC regulation as they perceive it as a "death blow"
* Investment contracts and the *Howey* test:
    - SCOTUS defines investment contract as (SEC v. W.J. Howey Co, 1948)
        1. Investment of money
        2. Common enterprise
        3. Reasonable expectation of profit
        4. Based on efforts of others
* Regulation by enforcement:
    - Jun. 2018: Bitcoin and Ether are "sufficiently decentralized"
    - Apr. 2019: dozens of factors relevant to "based on efforts of others"
    - Since then: efforts by chair Gary Gensler to classify digital assets as securities

### Commodities laws

* Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC")
    - Mission: promote integrity, resilience, vibrancy of US derivatives markets: futures, options, swaps, etc.
    - Created 1974 when most futures were traded in agriculture market
    - Responsibilities greatly expanded after Great Recession + Dodd-Frank Act of 2010
* CFTC-SEC turf war: are cryptocurrencies securities or commodities?
    - General industry preference for CFTC due to friendlier positions, until Ooki DAO

### Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws

* Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN): enforces Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) - US AML/countering terrorism financing (CFT) laws
    - Requires regulated financial institutions to comply with certain AML program compliance requirements - incl. Know Your Customer (KYC)
    - Includes centralized crypto institutions like exchanges and custodions
* Crypto x AML
    - In general, BSA deputizes financial intermediaries to perform task of surveiling our transactions and reporting on them to government

### Sanctions laws

* Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
    - Sanctions: foreign policy tool used to influence behavior and diminish capabilities of foreign actors through economic penalties
    - OFAC administers US sanctions by designated specific targets on Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, who are then cut off from US markets
        - Illegal for any US-based person to transact w/ anyone on SDN list
* Crypto x Sanctions
    - Sanctions compliance enforced on US-based crypto traders + exchanges
        - Despite sometime difficulty of knowing who is on SDN list given "borderless" crypto; customers only identified by wallet addresses
    - Bittrex: $24m settlement in 2022 for violations from 2014-2016
    - Virgil Griffith: 63 mos. imprisonment for aiding North Korea
    - Policymakers think crypto is particularly useful for sanctions evasion
        - Guest lecturer claims not particularly, with exceptions of NK Lazarus Group generating revenue from ransomware payouts and DeFi hacks, argument as follows:
            1. Came up after Russia invaded Ukraine, concerns about Russia using crypto to evade sanctions
            2. Crypto does not really allow Russia to get physical assets
            3. Use-case of crypto too limited for broad-scale sanctions evasion in Russia: Bitcoin/Ruble, Ether/Ruble market too weak
            4. Affects average citizens in sanctioned countries trying to get access to financial services, less so nation states

#### My question: what about ransomware?

Guest lecturer response:

* Ransomware existed before crypto, but crypto makes ransomware profitable
    - Easier for ransomware actors to profit
* Need to get security house in order to prevent against attacks
    - Before ransomware - bad security state; ransomware makes security state more apparent
    - Argument: cannot use ransomware as an excuse for preventing average people from using crypto; "just clean up security"
* Ransomware has exposed how effective of Russia and other countries' (esp. NK) hacking operations, esp. state-sanctions
    - NK: ransomware serious source of revenue

### Tax laws

* Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
    - IRS is responsible for collecting US federal taxes and administering US tax code, including how it applies to digital assets
    - Unanswered questions about crypto taxes:
        - Mining and staking?
        - Hard forks and airdrops?
        - DeFi transactions and interest income
* Infrastructure bill
    - 2021: Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) amendment with 5 new crypto provisions, incl. KYC
        - Guest lecturer claims all are problematic

## Current issues and priorities

1. Privacy after TornadoCash mixer shutdown
    - Mixer: can pool crypto access in a wallet, then withdraw funds to a new, fresh wallet address
        - Allows users to obscure transaction flow
        - Abused by bad actors e.g. Lazarus Group for money-laundering purposes
    - Question: does OFAC have authority to make software illegal in the US?
2. Stablecoins after Terra collapse
    - Will centralized stablecoins get preferential treatments due to UST?
3. DAOs after Ooki
    - CFTC case: if governance token gets used to vote on protocol change, voter personally liable to CFTC case if commodities law violated
    - Question: are DAO voters personally liable for operating DeFi protocols?
4. DeFi after Lazarus
    - Can DeFi stay permissionless despite concerns about illicit finance
5. DCCPA, RFIA, DCA, etc.
    - Will Congress grant CFTC juisdiction over crypto spot markets?
6. Politics
    - How will Congress composition change outlook for US crypto policy?
