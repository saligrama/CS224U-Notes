# Ethereum

## Limitations of Bitcoin

* UTXO contains `ScriptPK` or hash thereof
    - Simple script: indicates conditions when UTXO can be spent
* However: difficult to maintain state in multi-stage contracts or to enforce global rules on assets
    - e.g. rate limiting: if wallet has 100 UTXOs, and want to enforce transfer of max 2BTC per day out of wallet, this is impossible!

### Example: NameCoin

* DNS on the blockchain
* Need operations:
    - `Name.new(OwnerAddr, DomainName)`: intent to register
    - `Name.update(DomainName, newVal, newOwner, OwnerSig)`
    - `Name.lookup(DomainName)`
    - note: also need to ensure no front-running on `Name.new()`
* UTXO for new, update:
    ```btc
    DUP HASH256 <OwnerAddr> EQVERIFY CHECKSIG VERIFY <NAMECOIN> <DomainName> <IPAddr> <1>
    ```
    - Limitation: cannot enforce "if I own a domain name, nobody else can register or update to that domain name"
    - Required a fork of Bitcoin to achieve
    - However: gave rise to **Ethereum**, which natively supports global state

## Cryptocurrencies as state transition systems

* Bitcoin: each transaction is a function mapping from set of possible world states, set of possible inputs -> set of possible world states
    - Limited functionality in these transactions: the mutation only executes over UTXOs transforming one UTXO to another UTXO
* Ethereum: much richer state transaction function
    - One transition executes an entire program

## Ethereum applications

* Ethereum DApps include:
    - New coins: ERC-20 standard interface
    - Decentralized finance: exchanges, lending, stablecoins, derivatives, etc
    - Insurance
    - Decentralized organizations
    - NFTs: managing asset ownership (ERC-721 interface)
* DApps run on:
    - Base: consensus layer: beacon chain
    - Compute layer: execution chain
    - Create DApp w/Program Code, runs on compute layer mapping states to states with transactions as transitions

## The Ethereum system

### Consensus layer: proof-of-stake

* One block every 12 seconds; about 150 Tx per block
    - Block proposer receives Tx fees for the block, along with other rewards
* Beacon chain: Eth2 (post-Sep. 2022) consensus layer
    - Validators, not miners
    - To become a validator: stake (lock up) 32 ETH, or use Lido
    - Validators:
        - Sign blocks to express correctness
        - Occasionally propose blocks (chosen at random)
        - Correct behavior: issued *new* ETH every epoch (32 blocks)
        - Incorrect behavior: slashed
* When consensus reached: `notify_new_payload(payload)` (Engine API) called, sends transactions to compute layer

### Compute layer: Ethereum Virtual Machine

* World state: set of accounts identified by 32-byte address
* Types of accounts:
    - Owned accounts: controlled by ECDSA signing pair `(pk, sk)`
    - Contracts: controlled by code (set at account creation time, does not change)

#### EVM structure and instructions

* Stack machine (like Bitcoin) but with JUMP (so loops allowed)
    - Max stack depth = 1024
    - Program aborts if stack size exceeded; block proposer keeps gas
    - Contract can *create* or *call* another contract
    - Opcodes at [evm.codes](https://evm.codes)
* Two types of zero-initialized memory:
    - Persistant storage (on blockchain), to use `SLOAD`, `SSTORE` (expensive)
    - Volatile memory (for single Tx): `MLOAD`, `MSTORE` (cheap)
    - `LOG0(data)`: write data to log
* Every instruction costs gas:
    - `SSTORE <addr>, <value>` (32 byte variables each)
    - zero -> nonzero: 20,000 gas
    - nonzero -> nonzero: 5,000 gas (for a cold slot)
    - nonzero -> zero: 15,000 gas refund (example)
        - Refunds given for reducing size of blockchain state: incentivizes contracts to clean up after themselves
        - However: refund has a maximum, cannot make money by just cleaning up the blockchain
    - `CREATE`: 32,000 + 200x code size gas
    - `CALL gas, addr, value, args`: call another contract
    - `SELFDESTRUCT addr`: kill current contract, 5000 gas


#### Account data

* Address (computed): 
    - Owned, `H(pk)`
    - Contracts: `H(CreatorAddr, CreatorNonce)`
* Code:
    - Owned: none
    - Contracts: `CodeHash`
* Storage root (state):
    - Owned: none
    - Contracts: `StorageRoot`
* Balance (in Wei = 10<sup>-18</sup> ETH, note GigaWei often used = 10<sup>-9</sup> ETH)
    - Both for humans and contracts
* Nonce:
    - Both for humans and contracts
    - Nonce = number of Tx sent + number of accounts created: anti-replay mechanism


#### Account state: persistent storage

* Every contract has associated storage array `S[]` w/capacity 2<sup>256</sup>-1, where each cell holds 32 bytes, init to 0
* Account storage root: Merkle Patricia Tree, keys are hash of `S[]`
    - Due to cannot compute full Merkle tree hash: 2<sup>256</sup> leaves

#### State transitions: Tx and messages

* Transactions: signed data by initiator, fields:
    - To: 32-byte address of target (0 means create new account)
    - From, [Signature]: initiator address and signature on Tx (if owned)
    - Value: # Wei being sent with Tx
    - Tx fees (EIP 1559): `gasLimit`, `maxFee`, `maxPriorityFee`
    - if To = 0: create new contract `code = (init, body)`
    - if To != 0: `data = (function, args)`
    - Nonce: must match current nonce of sender (to prevent Tx replay)
* Transaction types:
    - owned -> owned: transfer ETH between users
    - owned -> contract: call contract w/ETH and data
    - contract -> owned: contract sends funds to user
    - contract -> contract: one program calls another (and sends funds)
        - Enables composability of contracts
        - One transaction from user can lead to many Tx processed

#### An Ethereum Block

* Validators collect Txs from users => proposer creates a block of `n` Tx
    - To produce block, do:
        - for i = 1,...,n: execute state change of Tx<sub>i</sub> sequentially (can change state of >n accounts)
        - record updated world state in block
    - Other validators revalidate all Tx to verify block
        - sign block if valid; if enough sigs, finalizes epoch
* Block headers:
    - Consensus data: proposer ID, parent hash, votes, etc
    - Address of gas beneficiary (Tx fee recipient)
    - World state root: updated world state
        - Merkle Patricia Tree hash of all accounts in system
    - Tx root: Merkle hash of all Tx processed in block
    - Tx receipt root: Merkle hash of all log messages generated in block
    - Gas used: used to adjust gas price (target 15M gas per block)
* Total blockchain size, ETH world, Oct. 2022: 12TB

#### Gas calculation

* Why charge Tx fees (gas)?
    - Gas prevents submitting Tx that runs for many steps
    - During high load: block proposes Tx from mempool that maximize its income
        - Gas prices spike during congestion
* Old EVM (prior to Aug. 2021):
    - Every Tx contains a `gasPrice` "bid" (gas -> Wei conversion bid)
    - Producer chooses Tx w/highest `gasPrice` `(max sum(gasPrice * gasLimit))`
        - Not an efficient auction mechanism
        - Changed Aug. 2021 to second-choice auction type design
* EIP1559 EVM gas calculation:
    - Every block has a `baseFee`: minimum `gasPrice` for Tx in the block
    - `baseFee` computed from total gas in earlier blocks
        - Earlier blocks at gas limit (30M gas) - lots of congestion: base fees goes up 12.5% to discourage participation
        - Earlier blocks empty - no congestion: base fee decreases by 12.5% to encourage participation
        - If earlier blocks at "target size" (15M gas): base fee does not change
    - Transaction specifies three parameters:
        - `gasLimit`: max total gas allowed for Tx
        - `maxFee`: maximum allowed gas price
        - `maxPriorityFee`: additional "tip" to be paid to block proposer
    - Computed `gasPrice` bid in Wei: `gasPrice <- min(maxFee, baseFee + maxPrioirityFee)`
        - Max gas: `gasLimit * gasPrice`
        - Algorithm:
            1. `if gasPrice < baseFee`: abort
            2. if `gasLimit * gasPrice > msg.sender.balance`: abort
            3. deduct `gasLimit * gasPrice` from `msg.sender.balance`
            4. set `Gas <- gasLimit`
            5. execute Tx: deduct gas from `Gas` for each instruction
                - if at end `Gas < 0`: abort, mark Tx invalid (proposer keeps `gasLimit * gasPrice`)
            6. Refund `Gas * gasPrice` to `msg.sender.balance` (leftover change)
            7. `gasUsed <- gasLimit - Gas`
                - Burn `gasUsed * baseFee` (destroys ether, deflation)
                - Send `gasUsed * (gasPrice - baseFee)` to block producer (tip)
    - Why burn ETH?
        - Goals of EIP1559:
            - Incentivize users to bid true utility for posting Tx
            - Incentivize block proposer to not create fake Tx
            - Disincentivize off-chain agreements
        - Without burn (i.e., `baseFee` given to block producer):
            - In periods of low Tx, volume proposer would try to increase volume by offering to refund `baseFee` off-chain to users
