# Ethereum

## Limitations of Bitcoin

* UTXO contains `ScriptPK` or hash thereof
    - Simple script: indicates conditions when UTXO can be spent
* However: difficult to maintain state in multi-stage contracts or to enforce global rules on assets
    - e.g. rate limiting: if wallet has 100 UTXOs, and want to enforce transfer of max 2BTC per day out of wallet, this is impossible!

### Example: NameCoin

* DNS on the blockchain
* Need operations:
    - `Name.new(OwnerAddr, DomainName)`: intent to register
    - `Name.update(DomainName, newVal, newOwner, OwnerSig)`
    - `Name.lookup(DomainName)`
    - note: also need to ensure no front-running on `Name.new()`
* UTXO for new, update:
    ```btc
    DUP HASH256 <OwnerAddr> EQVERIFY CHECKSIG VERIFY <NAMECOIN> <DomainName> <IPAddr> <1>
    ```
    - Limitation: cannot enforce "if I own a domain name, nobody else can register or update to that domain name"
    - Required a fork of Bitcoin to achieve
    - However: gave rise to **Ethereum**, which natively supports global state

## Cryptocurrencies as state transition systems

* Bitcoin: each transaction is a function mapping from set of possible world states, set of possible inputs -> set of possible world states
    - Limited functionality in these transactions: the mutation only executes over UTXOs transforming one UTXO to another UTXO
* Ethereum: much richer state transaction function
    - One transition executes an entire program

## Ethereum applications

* Ethereum DApps include:
    - New coins: ERC-20 standard interface
    - Decentralized finance: exchanges, lending, stablecoins, derivatives, etc
    - Insurance
    - Decentralized organizations
    - NFTs: managing asset ownership (ERC-721 interface)
* DApps run on:
    - Base: consensus layer: beacon chain
    - Compute layer: execution chain
    - Create DApp w/Program Code, runs on compute layer mapping states to states with transactions as transitions

## The Ethereum system

### Consensus layer: proof-of-stake

* One block every 12 seconds; about 150 Tx per block
    - Block proposer receives Tx fees for the block, along with other rewards
* Beacon chain: Eth2 (post-Sep. 2022) consensus layer
    - Validators, not miners
    - To become a validator: stake (lock up) 32 ETH, or use Lido
    - Validators:
        - Sign blocks to express correctness
        - Occasionally propose blocks (chosen at random)
        - Correct behavior: issued *new* ETH every epoch (32 blocks)
        - Incorrect behavior: slashed
* When consensus reached: `notify_new_payload(payload)` (Engine API) called, sends transactions to compute layer

### Compute layer: Ethereum Virtual Machine

* World state: set of accounts identified by 32-byte address
* Types of accounts:
    - Owned accounts: controlled by ECDSA signing pair `(pk, sk)`
    - Contracts: controlled by code (set at account creation time, does not change)

#### Account data:

* Address (computed): 
    - Owned, `H(pk)`
    - Contracts: `H(CreatorAddr, CreatorNonce)`
* Code:
    - Owned: none
    - Contracts: `CodeHash`
* Storage root (state):
    - Owned: none
    - Contracts: `StorageRoot`
* Balance (in Wei = 10<sup>-18</sup> ETH, note GigaWei often used = 10<sup>-9</sup> ETH)
    - Both for humans and contracts
* Nonce:
    - Both for humans and contracts
    - Nonce = number of Tx sent + number of accounts created: anti-replay mechanism


#### Account state: persistent storage

* Every contract has associated storage array `S[]` w/capacity 2<sup>256</sup>-1, where each cell holds 32 bytes, init to 0
* Account storage root: Merkle Patricia Tree, keys are hash of `S[]`
    - Due to cannot compute full Merkle tree hash: 2<sup>256</sup> leaves

#### State transitions: Tx and messages

* Transactions: signed data by initiator, fields:
    - To: 32-byte address of target (0 means create new account)
    - From, [Signature]: initiator address and signature on Tx (if owned)
    - Value: # Wei being sent with Tx
    - Tx fees (EIP 1559): `gasLimit`, `maxFee`, `maxPriorityFee`
    - if To = 0: create new contract `code = (init, body)`
    - if To != 0: `data = (function, args)`
    - Nonce: must match current nonce of sender (to prevent Tx replay)
* Transaction types:
    - owned -> owned: transfer ETH between users
    - owned -> contract: call contract w/ETH and data
    - contract -> owned: contract sends funds to user
    - contract -> contract: one program calls another (and sends funds)
        - Enables composability of contracts
        - One transaction from user can lead to many Tx processed

#### An Ethereum Block

* Validators collect Txs from users => proposer creates a block of `n` Tx
    - To produce block, do:
        - for i = 1,...,n: execute state change of Tx<sub>i</sub> sequentially (can change state of >n accounts)
        - record updated world state in block
    - Other validators revalidate all Tx to verify block
        - sign block if valid; if enough sigs, finalizes epoch
* Block headers:
    - Consensus data: proposer ID, parent hash, votes, etc
    - Address of gas beneficiary (Tx fee recipient)
    - World state root: updated world state
        - Merkle Patricia Tree hash of all accounts in system
    - Tx root: Merkle hash of all Tx processed in block
    - Tx receipt root: Merkle hash of all log messages generated in block
    - Gas used: used to adjust gas price (target 15M gas per block)
* Total blockchain size, ETH world, Oct. 2022: 12TB

#### An example contract: NameCoin

ETH contracts are written in Solidity.

```solidity
contract nameCoin {
    struct nameEntry {
        address owner;
        bytes32 value;
    }

    mapping (bytes32 => nameEntry) data;

    // insecure: front-running bug, can be solved using committments
    function nameNew(bytes32 name) {
        // registration cost is 100 Wei
        if (data[name] == 0 && msg.value >= 100) {
            data[name].owner = msg.sender; // record domain owner
            emit Register(msg.sender, name); // log event
        }
    }

    function nameUpdate(bytes32 name, bytes32 newValue, address newOwner) {
        if (data[name].owner == msg.sender && msg.value >= 10) {
            data[name].value = newValue;
            data[name].owner = newOwner;
        }
    }

    // humans do not need this (i.e. etherscan.io)
    // used by other contracts
    function nameLookup(bytes32 name) {
        return data[name];
    }

}
```
