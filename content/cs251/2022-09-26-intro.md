# CS 251 Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Technologies

## This course

* Brings together: cryptography, distributed systems, economics

### Course organization

1. The starting point: Bitcoin mechanics
2. Consensus protocols
3. Ethereum and decentralized applications
4. DeFi: decentralized applications in finance
5. Private transactions on a public blockchain: SNARKs and zero-knowledge proofs
6. Scaling the blockchain: getting to 10K transactions/sec
7. Interoperability among chains: bridges and wrapped coins

## What is a blockchain?

* Consensus layer: public append-only data structure
    - Persistence: can never remove added data
    - Safety: all honest participants have same data
    - Liveness: honest participants can add new transactions
    - Open: anyone can add data (no authentication)
        - Not strict requirement
    - How are blocks added to chains?
        - End users A, B, C with secret keys SK<sub>A</sub>, SK<sub>B</sub>, SK<sub>C</sub>
        - Transactions sent to miners (validators) that operate blockchains
        - One validator randomly selected to create the next block
        - Next block sent to distributed other validators, validator gets "block reward" for work done in creating the block
        - Other validators verify transactions, lead validator only gets reward if transaction is verified
    - Why is consensus hard?
        - Good case: all copies are the same and valid
        - Problems:
            - Network delays: can affect transaction order
            - Network partition (severing connections between two parts of the world): how to merge lists after partition is resolved?
            - Crashes
            - Malicious participants
* Blockchain computer
    - Decentralized applications (DAPPs)
        - Run on blockchain: code and state written on chain
        - Accept transactions from users: state transitions recorded on chain
* User-facing servers
    - Cloud frontend that interact with DAPPs on change
    - End-users issue transactions via these servers
