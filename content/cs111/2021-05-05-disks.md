# Disks
* 6-12 platters, each with 200k inch tracks, 1000 sectors per track, 4096 bytes per sector
* Total capacity ~100GB to 18TB

## I/O operation
* Seek: position heads over track we want to read or write (2-10ms)
* Rotational latency: 4ms at 7500RPM
* Transfer: 100-150 MB/sec

## API:

```C++
void read(start_sector, sector_count, phys_mem_addr);
void write(start_sector, sector_count, phys_mem_addr);
```

Disk structure hidden because
* Inner tracks have fewer sectors
* Disk can remap bad sectors

## Device registers
* One block per device
* Words in physical memory
    - Parameters
    - Status bits ("completed", "error")
    - Control bits set by CPU ("start operation")
* Don't behave like memory
    - Some fields might always read as 0
    - Can change without being written to

### Operation
* Write register to start
* Ready bit reads as 0
* When operation does, ready bit reads as 1

### Interrupts
* "Interrupt enabled" (IE) bit in register
* After starting operation, OS will set this bit
* OS does something else
* When device becomes ready, checks IE bit
* If IE bit on, device interrupts when ready
    - Save IP and PS
    - Branch into OS, load new PS (stored in interrupt vector)
* Disable IE in handler

Multi-core machines: spread interrupts to many cores

## Direct memory acess
* Device can transfer to/from memory directly
* Fixes inefficiency of programmed I/O, where OS feeds data through device register
