# CS 161 Design and Analysis of Algorithms

## About the course

### Course goals

* The design and analysis of algorithms
    - These go hand in hand
* In this course
    - Learn to think analytically about algorithms
    - Flesh out an "algorithmic toolkit"
    - Learn to communicate clearly about algorithms

### Guiding questions

* Does it work?
* Is it fast?
* Can I do better?
* Should it work?
* Should it be fast?

### Logistics

Lectures
* Mon/Wed 9:45 - 11:15
* First two weeks: On Zoom (link on Canvas)
* Later: In person (NVIDIA auditorium)

Resources
* Slides
* Videos
* Notes
* IPython Notebooks
* Concept check questions

Homework
* Weekly, assigned Wednesdays at 12:30 pm and due the next Wednesday at 11:59 pm
* Two parts: exercises and problems
    - Do exercises individually
    - Try the problems individually before discussing them
    - Can exchange ideas with classmates, but must write up solutions individually
    - Cite all collaborators as well as sources used

Exams
* Midterm: Feb 7-8 (48 hr window)
* Final: Wed Mar 16, 3:30pm-6:30pm

Grading:
* Weighting: HW (50%), Midterm (20%), Final (30%)
* Lowest of 8 homework scores dropped

Interaction with course staff
* Ed discussion forum
* Office hours (on Nooks)
* Sections (on Zoom)
    - Thursdays and Fridays
    - Optional but recommended

## Why algorithms?

### Algorithms are fundamental

Applications:

* Operating systems (CS140)
* Machine learning (CS229)
* Cryptography (CS255)
* Compilers (CS143)
* Networking (CS144)
* Computational biology (CS262)

### Algorithms are useful

* As inputs get bigger and bigger, have good algorithms becomes more and more important

## Integer multiplication

* Problem: take two n-digit numbers and multiply them
* Grade-school multiplication: takes roughly n<sup>2</sup> one-digit operations
    - Scales the same whether by hand or implemented in code
* Wizard's algorithm: O(n<sup>1.6</sup>)

### Divide and Conquer

* Ex. 1234 x 5678 
* = (12x100 + 34)(56x100 + 78)
* = (12x56)10000 + (34x56 + 12x78)100 + (34x78)
* = ...

**Algorithm Multiply(x, y)**

* if n == 1:
    - return xy
* Write x = a(10<sup>n/2</sup> + b)
* Write y = c(10<sup>n/2</sup> + d)
* Recursively compute ac, ad, bc, bd
    - ac = Multiply(a, c) etc...
* Add them up to get xy:
    - xy = ac(10<sup>n</sup>) + (ad + bc)(10<sup>n/2</sup>) + bd

Runtime: at each recursion step, we break a 2n-digit problem into 4 n-digit problems. This results in O(n<sup>2</sup>) performance.

### Karatsuba multiplication
* Recursively compute:
    - ac
    - bd
    - (a+b)(c+d) = ac + bd + bc + ad
* Subtract off ac and bd from (a+b)(c+d) we get (ad + bc) and can get the product
* Runtime: 3<sup>log<sub>2</sub> n</sup> ~= n<sup>1.6</sup>
