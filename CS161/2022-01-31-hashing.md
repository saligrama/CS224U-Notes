# Hashing

* Generic data structure that allows fast insert/delete/search
    - Doesn't need items to be comparable, only hashable
    - Idea: get better performance in expectation using randomness

## Primitive: direct addressing

* Suppose all keys are in the set {1..9}
* Create buckets 1..9
* Insert: map key *i* to bucket *i*
* Delete: remove from bucket *i*
* Search: look for bucket *i*

Problem: if keys are arbitrary, this requires a *lot* of memory

<u>An improvement: put items in buckets based on one digit</u>

* Problem with this: if keys have same common digit, one bucket becomes very large

**Hash functions improve bucket allocation by using randomness.**

## Terminology

* *U*: universe of size *M* (very very large)
* *n*: number of (distinct) elements of U we expect to see, where (*n* << *M*)

## Hash functions
* A hash function *h: U -> {1..n}* is a function that maps elements of *U* to buckets 1..n
    - Example: *h(x)* = least significant digit of *x*
    - For simplicity, we assume the number of buckets is *n*, although this doesn't need to be the case
    - In general, want #buckets = O(#elements we expect to see)

## Hash tables
* Array of *n* buckets, where each bucket stores a linked list
    - Can insert into a linked list in time O(1)
    - Search/deletion in a linked list takes time O(length(list))
    - Bucket index: given by hash function for any element
* Goals:
    - Not too many buckets (at most *n*) to not use too much space
    - Items should be spread out across buckets for fast insert/delete/search

## Designing a hash function
**Goal: Design a function *h: U -> {1..n}* where no matter what *n* items of *U* are adversarially chosen, buckets are balanced (i.e., O(1) entries per bucket)**

This requires a random hash function!

* If the function were deterministic, an adversary could pick inputs that are guaranteed to result in one bucket being overloaded

Testing parameters:

1. Adversary chooses *n* items u<sub>1</sub>...u<sub>*n*</sub> and any sequence of insert/search/delete operations on those items
2. Algorithm chooses random hash function *h: U -> {1..n}*
3. Hash table should provide O(1) search/insert/delete performance

**Refined goal: For all adversarial inputs u<sub>1</sub>..u<sub>*n*</sub>, and for all *i* in {1..*n*}, want E[length(list containing u<sub>i</sub>)] <= 2**

### Example: random hash function

* Suppose *h: U -> {1..n}* is a uniformly random function (h(1) is uniformly random between 1 and *n*); write down the generated permutation *h(i)* for all *i* in *U*
* Pro: Adversary has a very hard time trying to defeat this; fulfills expectation in refined goal
* Con: Needs a **lot** of storage space to store the permutation

### Hash families

* Cleverly chosen subset *H* of functions; only need log(|*H*|) bits to store an element of *H*
* e.g. *H* = {LeastSignificantDigit, MostSignificantDigit} and pick a random function in *H* for each element; use one bit to denote what we used

Universal hash families: hash family that satisfies P<sub>\{h in H\}</sub> {h(u<sub>*i*</sub>) = h(u<sub>*j*</sub>)} <= 1/*n* for all nonequal u<sub>*i*</sub>, u<sub>*j*</sub> in *U*

Example:

1. Pick prime *p* >=*M*
2. f<sub>a,b</sub>(x) = ax + b (mod p)
3. h<sub>a,b</sub>(x) = f<sub>a,b</sub>(x) (mod n)
4. H = {h<sub>a,b</sub> | a, b in {1..p-1}}

Using this structure: hash table takes O(n log M) bits of space

* O(n) buckets
* O(n) items requiring O(log M) bits each
* O(log M) bits for the hash function
