**NOTE (2022-10-30)**: the above website is the preferred way of viewing these notes, due to better search, math, formatting, and syntax highlighting support, and notes will only be updated live there (on the [hugo-dev](https://github.com/saligrama/notes/tree/hugo-dev) branch). Notes will be synced back here monthly.
